# HandWritting-Digit-Detection
Detect handwritten digit from images using scikit-learn. This is a final project for ET3107 "Pemrograman Lanjut" Course. 

# Installation
__NOTES__: This program currently only support Ubuntu. For windows, installation can be done using wsl. 
Clone this repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AdityaP1502/HandWritting-Digit-Detection
```

Install and creating virtual environment </br>
```shell
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv &&
sudo apt install python3-venv &&
python3 -m venv env && 
source env/bin/activate
```

Then install all python modules that are used by running commands below
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To run this project, you first must build all the neccessary C library. We write some function in C to sped up few process in the detection. 

Before running the build scripts, grant permission first by running this command:

```shell
chmod +x scripts/build.sh && chmod +x scripts/buildTest.sh
```
Then run this command to build all libs:
```shell
./scripts/build.sh
```

For windows user running in wsl, if found error
```shell
./scripts/build.sh: line 3: $'\r': command not found
./scripts/build.sh: line 69: syntax error: unexpected end of file
```
Change the EOL from CRLF(windows) TO LF(LINUX). You can use notepad++ EOL conversion for this. Then run the script again. 

## Model
Model can bew downloaded from: (rename the file into "KNeighbors.sav") </br>
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rvfo2WEzIkvAUbXdXMC7UPT72nd-i9dZ </br>
Placed the model file in __model/__.

# Run
To start detecting images, run this in root folder. (__windows__ user must run this via wsl)
```shell
python3 src/main/main.py -f [filename]
```
